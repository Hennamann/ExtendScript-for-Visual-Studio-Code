## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the extension.

### 1.1.0

- Added symbol support
- Added Intellisense support
- General Fixes
Do note that the symbol support added is based on Javascript/Typescript, which means most things work as expected but vscode may return weird errors in places where extendscripts es4 differs from the newer es6.
